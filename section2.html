        Ever since the team was sold in 2008, there has been a hole in the hearts of Sonics fans throughout
        the state of Washington. Seattle is a basketball city at heart and would do anything to get a team
        back in their city. There has been some recent conversation regarding bringing back a few expansion
        teams into both conferences so that Seattle can have their team but that has not yet happened.
        The documentary <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonicsgate">Sonicsgate</a></b> 
        dives into the controversy where the team had been taken from Seattle.
